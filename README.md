## Introduction
This project is done on US health insurance dataset.

also avalible on: [My Github](https://github.com/saeedshiranii/Health-Insurance/blob/main/insurance.csv)

This project is composed from Three Parts:
1. **EDA**
2. **ompetitive Analysis**
3. **User Insurance Panel**
## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us understand the features of our dataset and identify potential questions we can answer with this analysis. It allows us to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of the dataset.

## 2. Competitive Analysis
In this part of the project, I analyzed the dataset from the perspective of a company analyst, assuming it belongs to our competitor. Due to limitations in the dataset, I could only report observed phenomena without providing explanations or suggesting optimal strategies.

## 3. Insurance User Panel
In this section, I utilized the data to create a user panel aimed at determining the most suitable insurance payment for each user based on their individual conditions. The mechanism of this system is straightforward: it identifies past users with similar conditions to the current panel user and calculates the average payment of those users. Using the average value of payments made by others serves as a reliable measure to determine the optimal payment for the current user.

## Requirements

To work with this project, you'll need to have Python installed, along with these libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, plotly.express, matplotlib.pyplot.

If you want to run the dashboards, make sure to install Power BI Desktop as well.
